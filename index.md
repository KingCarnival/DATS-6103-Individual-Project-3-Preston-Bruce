# Steam Reviews February 2010-December 2019

## Quick Background

### Steam Reviews

Steam is the biggest online marketplace for digital video games.  In 2013 the platform first allowed the general userbase. This quickly gained a reputation for being  generally useless due to the large amount of reviews and the volatility of online actors.

Most notable of these is what is know as a 'Review Bomb" in which a game is give a mass of negative reviews by both users and bots. These attacks are usually provoked by either a poorly received press statement by the publisher or one of the crew working on the game.

### Early Access

Introduced on March 20, 2013  Early Access (henceforth EA) was introduced as a way for developers to get active feedback along with more funding from their player as the game continues its development.
